  "The Earth's atmosphere is divided into multiple layers, each serving a unique purpose. The troposphere, the lowest layer, extends only a few miles above the Earth's surface and is where all weather events occur. Above it, the stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation.<br><br>Airplanes prefer flying in the stratosphere as it offers a stable environment with minimal turbulence. Further up, the thermosphere is where charged particles exist, forming the ionosphere, which helps in radio wave transmission. Beyond that, the exosphere fades into space, containing very few molecules",
  "The world‚Äôs largest mammals, whales, travel great distances for migration. Many species breed in warm tropical waters, where conditions are ideal for their young. Among them, the humpback whale is known for its distinct songs and acrobatics. However, the 20th century saw excessive commercial whaling, leading to a dramatic decline in whale populations.<br><br>In 1986, an international ban on commercial whaling was enforced to protect these magnificent creatures. Some of the most breathtaking footage of these animals comes from places like South Africa, where marine life thrives in nutrient-rich waters.",

  "Artificial intelligence is powered by neural networks, which mimic the human brain. Instead of using simple classifications, these models rely on feature detection to recognize patterns in data. A critical component behind modern AI is GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which allow fast computations.<br><br>In the case of facial recognition, AI maps multiple facial features to identify individuals. The foundation of AI technology relies on vast amounts of big data, collected from various sources to train these intelligent systems.",
  "Computers and mobile devices rely on operating systems (OS) to function. Some well-known OSs include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, but not every system qualifies as a true OS. Apple provides two different platforms: macOS for computers and iOS for mobile devices. Meanwhile, Google dominates the mobile OS market with Android, powering millions of smartphones and tablets.<br><br>The fundamental role of an OS is to act as an intermediary between the user and the computer, managing hardware and software resources efficiently.",

  "In the digital world, encryption plays a crucial role in securing information. It works by scrambling plain text so that only authorized parties can read it. One of the most widely used mathematical operations for encryption is the modulus function, which ensures data security.<br><br>In cryptographic communication, a public key is used for encryption, while a private key is needed to decrypt messages. A key security technique in this field involves hashing and salting, which protects passwords and sensitive data from attacks.",
  "Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.<br><br>Machine learning, a subset of data science, focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. This learning process can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised, depending on the amount of information provided to the algorithm",

  // history
  "The Industrial Revolution reshaped the modern world, bringing technological advancements that changed industries forever. The term itself was coined by historian Arnold Toynbee to describe this transformative period. Among the most critical inventions of this era was the steam engine, which powered factories, ships, and trains.<br><br>However, the revolution wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the Agricultural Revolution, which ensured food supply for a growing workforce. It all began in the United Kingdom, later spreading to Europe and beyond.",
  "World War II was a global conflict fought between the Allied Powers and the Axis Powers. The United States, alongside its allies, fought against nations like Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war saw some of the darkest events in human history, including the dropping of the atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, which marked the beginning of the end. <br><br>While Japan, Germany, and Italy formed the core of the Axis, the USSR (Soviet Union) was not part of this group. The war lasted from 1939 to 1945, shaping the modern world order.",

  "A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored non-contiguously in memory. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node, allowing dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions or deletions. Unlike arrays, linked lists don‚Äôt require resizing. Variants like singly, doubly, and circular linked lists offer flexibility for different use cases, such as navigation in browsers or memory-efficient queues.",
  "A graph is a non-linear data structure made of nodes (called vertices) connected by edges. It can be directed or undirected, depending on whether the connections have a direction. Graphs are used to model networks like social media, maps, or the internet. A common way to represent a graph is with an adjacency list, which is memory-efficient compared to an adjacency matrix.<br><br>Traversal algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) explore level by level, while DFS (Depth-First Search) dives deep along a path before backtracking.",

  // maths
  "Mathematics, often abbreviated as 'math', is the study of topics such as quantity, structure, space, and change. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including algebra, geometry, and calculus. Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It is fundamental to many areas of mathematics, including geometry and calculus, and has numerous applications in the real world.<br><br>Geometry, on the other hand, is the study of shapes, sizes, positions, and dimensions of objects. It has been a subject of study for thousands of years, with its roots tracing back to ancient civilizations.",
  "Mathematics is a powerful language used to describe and understand the world around us. It goes far beyond basic arithmetic, diving into advanced areas like number theory, which studies the unique properties and patterns of integers. Calculus helps us understand change and motion‚Äîone key result is that the derivative of  e^x is still ùëí^ùë•.<br><br>Combinatorics focuses on counting and arrangements; for example, there are exactly 24 different ways to arrange the letters in the word ‚ÄúMATH.‚Äù In linear algebra, matrices are studied to understand systems and transformations, and their eigenvalues reveal deep structural insights. Mastering these concepts help develop precision in thinking and problem-solving across all scientific fields.",
